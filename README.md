# Solar Panel




## Materials Used

- A copper board/plate
- ferric chloride solution (found the solution on Amazon)
- zinc paste with a 40% concentration of zinc (from dentist shop)
- some paper towels
-  clear nail polish 
- hair dryer


## Process

The copper board acts as the foundation of the solar panel as it is a great conductor of electricity and will allow electrons to flow through it. On the copper board, I drew on a “circuit” with a Sharpie, this was essential as the black ink from the Sharpie absorbs heat, as opposed to reflecting it (which lighter colours do).
Think of it like this, if we go outside in a black shirt when it was 25 degrees celsius outside, we would feel a lot sweatier compared to if we wore a white shirt instead. This is because darker colours tend to absorb heat more than lighter colours. What we want to do with the solar panel is to optimize how efficient it is, and therefore, use a black Sharpie so that the panel can capture as much heat as possible.
Then I have the ferric chloride etching solution which is used after the copper board has the Sharpie on it. As the corrosive salt (it is, in fact, not an acid) interacts with the copper, it produces a sediment. That sediment is used to etch the copper as it moves into the lines. It is important to note that the copper was submerged in the ferric chloride for 10 minutes (in a plastic tupperware) and being constantly moved to ensure even etching.The purpose of etching the “circuit” was to provide the electrons from the photons with a path to flow through.
After it was submerged in the ferric chloride, the copper board was rinsed off in clean water and sprayed with isopropyl alcohol which was then rubbed off with the remaining black sharpie. Please note that the alcohol was only used to ensure the copper was clean and safe to touch. I then used the Burt’s Bees cream which contained a 40% zinc paste and spread a thin layer of it over the side of the panel which had the etching on it and then dried it with a blowdryer to ensure that it was clear. The zinc was used to increase the speed at which the electrons could travel at within the cell. Overall, it is used to amplify the total conductivity of the cell.
Finally, a thin layer of clear nail polish was applied to the etched side of the solar panel to not only protect it from damage but also capture more light as a shiny, clear surface is much more likely to attract light to it. Whereas, a worn, ‘frosted’ surface would reflect light away from it.
Well, before I talk about all the sciencey stuff, it is important to remember that electricity is the flow of electrons throughout a conductor (usually a metal wire).

Now, onto the interesting part! I put the solar panel on a windowsill and exposed it to the sun, the panel absorbed the energy from the sun (photons). After this, in order for the electrons to flow throughout the etched “circuit”, the electrons had to break their atomic bond to the nucleus. This happens through an input of energy that gives the electron enough energy to overpower the electromagnetic force that is keeping it confined to the atom, pushing it out of the atom and letting it flow freely.

In this case, the solar radiation emitted from the sun was our input of energy energy. Therefore, the solar radiation gave the electrons enough energy to break through the electromagnetic field and flow through the etched “circuit” in the copper board, creating an electrical current. This electrical current essentially flowed through the copper board and two wires that connect to an ammeter which measured the electrical current that the entire solar panel conducts.

In the image below, you can see that the panel produced 62.6 millivolts, which is not a lot but at the same time, the panel is small so naturally, it would not produce a lot of energy. That said, if I were to attach a battery to the 2 wires instead of an ammeter, I could eventually charge the battery and charge my phone.





## Conclusion

Finally, the last thing I would like to add is that the reason they look so tarnished is probably because there was a very thin layer of clear nail polish that was applied to the copper. In the future, if I do make another solar panel, I will definitely add more clear nail polish to make sure that the copper does not tarnish and the solar panel can be used for a longer period of time.
